This repository contains the official code for our paper on DeepSSIM, a novel automated metric for detecting training data memorization in generative models applied to medical imaging. While generative models show great promise in generating synthetic medical data, they are vulnerable to memorizing sensitive information. DeepSSIM addresses this risk by detecting and quantifying memorized content.<br/>
We evaluate DeepSSIM in a case study involving synthetic Brain MRI data generated by a **Latent Diffusion Model (LDM)** trained under memorization-prone conditions, using **2,195 2D MRI scans** from two publicly available datasets - **IXI** and **CoRR**. Compared to state-of-the-art memorization metrics, DeepSSIM achieves superior performance, improving F1 score by an average of __+52.03%__ over the best existing method.
